    <h2>Advisor turned developer. Here to code a better future.</h2>
    <p>I spent the first decade of my career evolving from web designer to digital marketing consultant and then to executive advisor focused on creating a better future with tech. However, I missed building solutions with nothing more than my hands, a keyboard, and a natural propensity for lifelong learning.</p>
    <p>General Assembly's full stack Web Development Immersive was the best way for me to quickly return to my technical roots and get up-to-speed on the latest methodologies and frameworks. I now spend my free time experimenting with Three.js, completing kata on CodeWars and dreaming about bug fixes.</p>
    <p>My background has given me skills</p>
