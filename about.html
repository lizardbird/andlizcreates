      <p>I started my own business in college and spent a decade evolving from freelance web designer to digital marketing manager to executive advisor at a firm founded by futurists. The work was challenging, impactful, and prestigious, but ultimately I missed taking ideas from concept to reality with nothing more than a few sketches, a keyboard, and a natural propensity for lifelong learning.</p>
      <p>So I quit my job, went to code school at General Assembly, and now I build responsive sites and apps. Because of my background, I can also create empathy-driven user experiences and manage people, products, and programs. The balance of art and science involved in creating digital experiences allows me to use my natural creativity, work with a variety of teams and skillsets, and engineer solutions at the same time. This career pivot was the best decision I've ever made!</p>
      <p>When I'm not debugging code or organizing my Trello board, you can find me hanging with my husband, Mike, and our dog, Juneau, planning a trip to an international destination or National Park, reading books, watching Netflix and HBO, or listening to my latest downloads on PocketCast and Audible.</p>
      <p>Wanna work together? Drop me a line!</p>
